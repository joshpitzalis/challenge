                  Once you know what you offer and who it will benefit, the next
                  step is to start outreach to people who will benefit from your
                  service. This combines reaching out to people directly as well
                  as following up with your existing professional network. Most
                  people already have a professional network that they can tap
                  onto: your old colleagues, friends who work in similar
                  industries, acquantainces that you;ve never followed up with.
                  This week is about understanding how to turn your professional

                  A common mistake freelancers make is to think that people will
                  automatically become paid clients once they've express an
                  intest in working with you. Going from potential client to
                  paid client is a delicate process. From understanding what
                  their problem, demonstrating that you can help them, to
                  pitching your solution, you need to demonstrate your value and
                  worth at each stage of this process to make people want to
                  work with you.

                  Getting your first client is just the beginning, that's when
                  the real work start. It's important to understand how to wqork
                  with client by establishing clear expectations, boundaries,
                  milestones and deadline. Once you project is ocmplete you also
                  need a system in place for collecting feedback and staying in
                  touch with your client to develop a long term relationship.
